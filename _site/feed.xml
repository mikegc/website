        <title>Happy new year!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For me 2014 has been full of Sass, Grunt, Bower, components, mobile and responsiveness. Outside of work it has been ice hockey, weight lifting, weddings, Malta, DIY and loads more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year I plan to put some more meaningful stuff on my site. I have moved away from Wordpress to using Jekyll to generate static pages (it is still basic, but you coud call it MVP). The reason for this is I want something which I have more control over, and dont have to set up a load of stuff that I dont want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for now, have a great new year!&lt;/p&gt;
