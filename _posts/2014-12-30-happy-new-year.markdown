For me 2014 has been full of Sass, Grunt, Bower, components, mobile and responsiveness. Outside of work it has been ice hockey, weight lifting, weddings, Malta, DIY and loads more!

Next year I plan to put some more meaningful stuff on my site. I have moved away from Wordpress to using Jekyll to generate static pages (it is still basic, but you could call it MVP). The reason for this is I want something which I have more control over, and dont have to set up a load of stuff that I don't want to use.

But for now, have a great new year!
